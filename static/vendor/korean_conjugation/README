==Installation==

If you don't have easy_install, search for it on your favorite search engine and install it.

Then, follow these steps to build a self-contained environment for running the development server:

sudo easy_install pip
sudo easy_install virtualenv
virtualenv . --no-site-packages
pip install -E . -r requirements.txt
source bin/activate
python test.py
./dev_server
